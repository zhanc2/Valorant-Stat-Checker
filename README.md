# Valorant-Stat-Checker
Discord bot that gets player statistics for the game "Valorant"

The bot is coded in python using Discord's built in API.

This uses the website tracker.gg/valorant and due to Riot Game's policy, players must be signed in on the website in order for their player data to be publicly available.
